Hi everyone!

My name is Asura Enkhbayar and I am Master's student in Cognitive Science at the University of Vienna. My background is in electrical engineering, which means that I'm quite proficient at changing light bulbs. Apart from superiour light-bulb-replacing-skills, I also acquired the skill to produce more or less properly working code (mostly data sciency & web-dev projects).

Currently I am utterly lost in the world of [*isms](http://phrontistery.info/isms.html) and as I am a supporter of _Open *_<a href="#openness"><sup>1</sup></a>, I decided to start this blog and try to openly disentangle my thoughts.

__Open... but how?__

The answer is:   [__Hypothesis__](https://hypothes.is)


In addition comments as they are usually deployed on blogs, I decided to enable hypothesis annotations per default. Every visitor on this blog should see the additional sidebar on the right side of the window. This bar is Hypothesis! To find out more about the features of Hypothesis have a look at my first blog post!

__tl;dr__ You will find texts about cognitive science, open science, philosophy and some other stuff. Feel free to use [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is) to leave annotations and highlights.
